<div class="text-column">
	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>
		This is a simple SvelteKit application that I'm using to experiment with different web
		technologies, and documment my findings.
	</p>

	<p>
		It will start out as an extremely bare-bones site, and I'll add more features as I check out
		more technologies.
